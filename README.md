# CarbonWheel - Carbon Credits on Flow

**CarbonWheel** is a platform that incentivizes electric vehicle (EV) users by rewarding them with carbon credits for their contributions to environmental sustainability.

## Overview

CarbonWheel uses blockchain technology to make carbon credits easily accessible for EV users. We help users convert their emissions savings into carbon credit NFTs, which are pooled together with other users’ credits. These pooled carbon credits are then auctioned off to large companies, and the profits are redistributed to the users, with CarbonWheel taking a small cut for platform maintenance and operation.

## Integration with Flow

We have integrated **Flow** by leveraging its blockchain to create carbon credit NFTs. Users don’t trade their credits directly. Instead, when they mint their credits, they are added to a larger pool. The pooled carbon credits are sold at auction to corporations looking to offset their carbon footprints, and the profits from these auctions are distributed back to the users in proportion to their contributions.
