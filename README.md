# CarbonWheel - Carbon Credits on Flow

## 1. A clear short one-sentence description
CarbonWheel is a platform that incentivizes electric vehicle (EV) users by rewarding them with carbon credits for their contributions to environmental sustainability.

## 2. A short description of what you integrated Flow with and how
We integrated Flow by creating carbon credit NFTs on the blockchain. When users mint their carbon credits, they are added to a pool along with credits from other users. These pooled credits are auctioned off to large companies, and the profits are redistributed back to the owners, with a small cut taken by the platform.
